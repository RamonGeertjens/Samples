## Getting Started with Ruby
### Windows
  To install ruby on windows visit [Ruby Installer](https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads)

### MacOS / Linux
  While ruby may come pre-packaged within these operating systems, we recommend using [Ruby Version Manager](https://rvm.io/) in order to avoid altering the operating system's native ruby installation.

#### Samanage Gem Installation
Ruby examples utilize the [Samanage](https://rubygems.org/gems/samanage) ruby gem which can be installed via `gem install samanage`



## Getting Started with Python

Python examples utilize the python requests module and support [Python 3.x](https://python.org/downloads)
